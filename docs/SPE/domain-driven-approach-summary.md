# Italian Traffic Management System

## Explaining the Premise

As outlined in the project proposal, the objective is to develop an application capable of performing Traffic Management, referred to as TMS or Traffic Management System. The focus is on mimicking and simulating how a system would handle traffic at intersections, based on Italian driving laws. Specifically, the goal is to influence the timing of Traffic Lights based on the number of cars present at each intersection.

The domain for this application encompasses traffic, driving laws, conventions, and habits of land drivers. It's important to note that "Traffic Management" in this context specifically refers to the management of ground vehicle traffic, as opposed to Naval and Air traffic, which are separate domains.

## Knowledge Crunching by Event Storming

Knowledge Crunching was executed using an Event Storming methodology, facilitated by the Miro tool. The process involved the collaborative gathering of ideas and knowledge on the topic. Each team member acquired information independently before coming together to consolidate their insights on the domain.

Miro simplified this process by enabling the construction of a Mind Map. This map contained key concepts related to the project's environment. Using words and connecting them, hierarchies of concepts were formed to enhance the understanding of the domain.
