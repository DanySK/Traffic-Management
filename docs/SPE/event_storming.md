 # Knowledge Crunching by Event Storming

The way Knowledge Crunching was done, is by using an Event Storming based methodology, by using a tool called Miro, which let the three of us gather ideas and knowledge on the topic, which we acquired beforehand, in order for everybody to gather information separately and form ideas on the dominion, and put them together afterwards.
Miro simplified this process by letting us construct a Mind Map, which contained the main concepts regarding the environment of the project, by creating words and connecting each other, in order to form hierarchies of concepts to flesh them out better.

After forming the Mind Map and therefore having a high level vision of the matter, we decided to form a Ubiquitous Language regarding the dominion, which contains all the explanations in detail for the concepts that we will be using throughout the length of the project (as seen below).

The final part that was developed by the Knowledge Crunching session, was the Requirements Analysis, which integrated information that was gathered by creating the previously mentioned Mind Map and Ubiquitous Language. So the analysis performed went into details, on a high-level concept, of what are the Functional Requirements of the project itself, in order to produce a function Proof of Concept.
